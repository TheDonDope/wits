# Wits - The Weed Information Tracking System

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/TheDonDope/wits/graph/badge.svg?token=QM1XTAUsfU)](https://codecov.io/gh/TheDonDope/wits)

Wits aims to help cannabis patients and users to manage and monitor their cannabis consumption and inventory.

## Building the Application

Building the binary requires multiple steps:

- Compiling the Tailwind CSS output
- Generating the Go code from the Templ Templates
- Building the Go binary

To do this in one command, run the following (alternatively `$ task build` if you are using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/)):

```shell
$ make build
curl -L -o public/js/htmx.min.js https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10/dist/htmx.min.js

The built application binary can be started by:

```shell
$ ./bin/wits

## Running Tests

- Run the testsuite with coverage enabled (alternatively `$ task test` if you are using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/)):

```shell
$ make test
go test -race -v ./... -coverprofile coverage.out
?    github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/types [no test files]
?    github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view [no test files]
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/handler  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/cmd  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/dashboard  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/layout  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/auth  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/storage  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/ui  coverage: 0.0% of statements
```

- Generate the coverage results as html (alternatively `$ task cover` if you are using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/)):

```shell
$ make cover
go test -race -v ./... -coverprofile coverage.out
?    github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/types [no test files]
?    github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view [no test files]
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/cmd  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/handler  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/auth  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/ui  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/layout  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/storage  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/dashboard  coverage: 0.0% of statements
go tool cover -html coverage.out -o coverage.html
[Empty output on success]
```

- Open the results in the browser (alternatively `$ task show-cover` if you are using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/)):

```shell
$ make show-cover
go test -race -v ./... -coverprofile coverage.out
?    github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/types [no test files]
?    github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view [no test files]
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/cmd  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/handler  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/storage  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/ui  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/auth  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/layout  coverage: 0.0% of statements
 github.com/TheDonDope/wits/pkg/view/dashboard  coverage: 0.0% of statements
go tool cover -html coverage.out -o coverage.html
open coverage.html
<Opens Browser>
```

Both the `coverage.out` as well as the `coverage.html` are explicitly ignored from source control (see [.gitignore](.gitignore)).
